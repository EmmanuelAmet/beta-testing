                <h3>THE SAGE COMPUTER ALGEBRA SYSTEM</h3>
                <p>One of the most important new features for this edition is the use of Sage for cryptographic examples and homework assignments.Sage is an open-source,multiplatform,freeware package that implements a very powerful,flexible,and easily learned
                    mathematics and computer algebra system. Unlike competing systems (such as Mathematica, Maple, and MATLAB), there are no licensing agreements or fees involved. Thus, Sage can be made available on computers and networks at school, and
                    students can individually download the software to their own personal computers for use at home. Another advantage of using Sage is that students learn a powerful, flexible tool that can be used for virtually any mathematical application,not
                    just cryptography. The use of Sage can make a significant difference to the teaching of the mathematics of cryptographic algorithms.This book provides a large number of examples of the use of Sage covering many cryptographic concepts
                    in Appendix B. Appendix C lists exercises in each of these topic areas to enable the student to gain hands-on experience with cryptographic algorithms.This appendix is available to instructors at the IRC for this book.Appendix C includes
                    a section on how to download and get started with Sage,a section on programming with Sage,and includes exercises that can be assigned to students in the following categories:</p>

                <h3>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h3>
                <p>This new edition has benefited from review by a number of people who gave generously of their time and expertise.The following people reviewed all or a large part of the manuscript: Marius Zimand (Towson State University), Shambhu Upadhyaya
                    (University of Buffalo), Nan Zhang (George Washington University), Dongwan Shin (New Mexico Tech), Michael Kain (Drexel University),William Bard (University of Texas), David Arnold (Baylor University), Edward Allen (Wake Forest University),
                    Michael Goodrich (UC-Irvine), Xunhua Wang (James Madison University),Xianyang Li (Illinois Institute of Technology),and Paul Jenkins (Brigham Young University). Thanks also to the many people who provided detailed technical reviews
                    of one or more chapters: Martin Bealby, Martin Hlavac (Department of Algebra, Charles University in Prague,Czech Republic),Martin Rublik (BSP Consulting and University of Economics in Bratislava),Rafael Lara (President of Venezuela’s
                    Association for Information Security and Cryptography Research), Amitabh Saxena, and Michael Spratte (Hewlett-Packard Company). I would especially like to thank Nikhil Bhargava (IIT Delhi) for providing detailed reviews of various
                    chapters of the book. Joan Daemen kindly reviewed the chapter on AES. Vincent Rijmen reviewed the material on Whirlpool.Edward F.Schaefer reviewed the material on simplified AES. Nikhil Bhargava (IIT Delhi) developed the set of online
                    homework problems and solutions.Dan Shumow of Microsoft and the University of Washington developed all of the Sage examples and assignments in Appendices B and C. Professor Sreekanth Malladi of Dakota State University developed the
                    hacking exercises. Lawrie Brown of the Australian Defence Force Academy provided the AES/DES block cipher projects and the security assessment assignments. Sanjay Rao and Ruben Torres of Purdue University developed the laboratory exercises
                    that appear in the IRC.The following people contributed project assignments that appear in the instructor’s supplement:Henning Schulzrinne (Columbia University);Cetin Kaya Koc (Oregon State University);and David Balenson (Trusted Information
                    Systems and George Washington University).Kim McLaughlin developed the test bank. Finally, I would like to thank the many people responsible for the publication of the book,all of whom did their usual excellent job.This includes my
                    editor Tracy Dunkelberger, her assistant Melinda Hagerty, and production manager Rose Kernan.Also, Jake Warde of Warde Publishers managed the reviews. With all this assistance, little remains for which I can take full credit. However,
                    I am proud to say that,with no help whatsoever,I selected all of the quotations.</p>

            <p>William Stallings has made a unique contribution to understanding the broad sweep of technical developments in computer security, computer networking and computer architecture. He has authored 17 titles, and counting revised editions, a total
                of 42 books on various aspects of these subjects.His writings have appeared in numerous ACM and IEEE publications,including the Proceedings of the IEEE andACM Computing Reviews. He has 11 times received the award for the best Computer
                Science textbook of the year from the Text and Academic Authors Association. In over 30 years in the field, he has been a technical contributor, technical manager, and an executive with several high-technology firms.He has designed and
                implemented both TCP/IP-based and OSI-based protocol suites on a variety of computers and operating systems, ranging from microcomputers to mainframes. As a consultant, he has advised government agencies,computer and software vendors,and
                major users on the design,selection,and use of networking software and products. He created and maintains the Computer Science Student Resource Siteat WilliamStalIings.com/StudentSupport.html.This site provides documents and links on a
                variety of subjects of general interest to computer science students (and professionals). He is a member of the editorial board of Cryptologia,a scholarly journal devoted to all aspects of cryptology. Dr. Stallings holds a PhD from M.I.T.
                in Computer Science and a B.S. from Notre Dame in electrical engineering.
